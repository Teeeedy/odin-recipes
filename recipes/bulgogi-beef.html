                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Bulgogi which when translated literally means (fire meat) is a dish made up of thin marinated slices of beef or pork that are grilled, barbecued or fried. It's usually eaten with a side of rice or with lettuce wraps. This dish is a classic Korean dish and is a staple in many Korean households and is widely popular even among foreigners due to the large growth of Korean culture outside of the country.</p>
                <p>It is incredibly easy to make with most of the cooking time marinating the meant and only requires you to do a quick stir fry. Along with being easy to make it's also extremely flavorful! But of course that will depend on how long you let the meat sit in the marinate. Overall it's a great dish, so why don't you try making it yourself!</p>
